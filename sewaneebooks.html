<p>References<br><br>
Reference 1: <a href = "OneJohnSt.html" id = "ref1"> Gradient Idea</a><br>
Once we figured out what we wanted our background to be, we decided to search up how
to create a gradient. Then, we started testing how different color combinations look on different types of gradients. This reference is a perfect example of how we want our background to look.<br><br>

Reference 2: <a href = "bncollege.html" id = "ref2"> Home Page Top Section Layout</a><br>
For our home page, we created a banner and a menu for specific textbook categories. This accessibility guideline will help us be organized with our multiple html pages. Along with the home page, we implemented a search bar that will be used once the webpage is completed. Futhermore, we will include buttons that will allow users to create an account and login. This will provide easy navigation for our website.<br><br>

Reference 3: <a href = "befunky.html" id = "ref3"> Images Layout</a><br>
This reference is a photo editor, collage maker, and designer website. The use of multiple images in a collage fashion catches the attention of the users. We planned to put two sepereate collage's on the side of the references box but were unable to implement it in the time allocated.</p>
